# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of Code is a daily coding challenge that takes place during Advent.

## Why I love this:
No matter where you look - the news, our communities, our homes, or even inside ourselves - we find that the world is broken.  Throughout history, we've tried and tried to fix this brokenness ourselves, but we see time and time again that it hasn't worked.  There's still violence; there's still selfishness; there's still strife.

We can't fix it ourselves.

Advent is one of my favorite times of the year, but what does "Advent" really mean?
The word "Advent" stems from the word "coming" in Latin, and at Christmas time we celebrate both the first time Jesus came into the world as well as waiting excitedly/expectantly for the time when He comes back to earth again.  

During Advent as we wait for Christmas, we get to remember the greatest joy that we could possibly know: that Jesus came into the world in order to reverse all of the bad; in order to fix all of the problems that we couldn't.

In Christmas, we celebrate God sending His son Jesus to love the world and to live in the world.  It's so special, because it is the point at which God revealed to us His plan to fix all of those problems by fixing *the* problem of our imperfection and sin that was separating us from His perfect goodness.  Jesus came into the world at Christmas, died to pay for our sins on Good Friday, and rose from the dead on Easter so that we too could live eternally with God.

So with that, I hope you enjoyed learning about why I love Advent, and I hope that you have a good Advent and a blessed Christmas!

In addition to that, we get to do some fun coding challenges during Advent as well, which seemed like a great opportunity to learn some more Rust :)
